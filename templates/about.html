            <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                ExpiredDomain.dev uses zone files from ICANN's Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS). 
                These zone files contain the complete list of registered domains for each tracked top-level domain (TLD).

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">What Are Dropped Domains?</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                A "dropped domain" is a domain that was present in yesterday's zone file but is missing from today's zone file. 
                This typically indicates that the domain registration has expired or been deleted.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                By comparing zone files day by day, we can identify which domains have been dropped, 
                providing valuable insights for domain monitoring and research purposes.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">Disclaimer</h2>
            <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                This service is provided for research and monitoring purposes only. 
                The fact that a domain appears as "dropped" does not guarantee that it is available for registration. 
                Domains may be in grace periods, redemption periods, or may have been re-registered immediately after dropping.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                Always verify domain availability through official registrars before attempting to register a domain.
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-700">
                <li>Zone files are downloaded daily from ICANN CZDS (or manually placed in the data directory)</li>
                <li>Each day's zone file is parsed to extract all registered domains</li>
                <li>Domains from yesterday are compared with today's domains</li>
                <li>Domains that disappeared are marked as "dropped" and stored in the database</li>
                <li>The web interface allows you to browse, search, and filter these dropped domains</li>
            </ol>
